# Write a while loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 40.
index = 0
number = 0
while index < 40
    number = number + 2
    p number
    index = index + 1 
end
# i definitely need more practice at loops, however more complex ones that really challenge me on my thinking and problem solving. tomorrow i will scroll through the deliberate practice and trry to find a challenging loop
