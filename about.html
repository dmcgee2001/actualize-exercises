            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <p>I am 22 years old. I love playing video games and spending time with my girlfriend. I like hiking and trying new things. I'm a hard worker who wants to be the best at what I do. Jesus is the most important thing in my life. I am a coder-in-training!</p>

            <h2>A Deeper Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate guy who wants to discover the capablities of my mind and body. I am curious about the world around me, and I'm always eager to learn, adapt, and grow. Whether I'm delving into a new game, traveling to unfamiliar places, or engaging in meaningful conversations, I am always wanting to journey to the unknown. I believe in the power of people and the world around us, and always do my best to be a good and kind man to anyone I encounter. Embracing challenges and cherishing the moments of joy, I'm taking every day step by step to try and collect myself and become the best version of me I can be, one step at a time.</p>
