My name is Derek McGee. I am 22 years old and I currently work at the airport in Columbus, Ohio. I thought about going to a conventional 4-year college for a computer science degree, however I have a friend/former coworker who did  a tech bootcamp and told me that it taught everything he needed to know about the field. I want to begin a career in development/coding because I have always been interested in learning new skills and this is one of the skill that I believe will be extremely useful for understanding the evolving world around me.
